# Project_PythonDataIES
Python project by Alessandra Lupini and Alexander Mačejovský

## The final version of our project is stored in "Final Project" brench.

We scraped data from one of the most used website in Italy "https://www.ilmeteo.it/portale/archivio-meteo". We then processed the data that we get in order to perform analysis. The analysis has been made by looking at the evolutions in variables from 1985 to 2019. Our goal is to understand how the climate has changed in Italy.
