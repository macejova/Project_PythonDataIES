# Project_PythonDataIES
Python project by Alessandra Lupini and Alexander Mačejovský

### Current info: 
We have 4 lists of dataframes - for each quarter of the year. Inside of them dataframes are still ordered first by the city, then by the year, so first city takes 1st-35th dataframe etc.

### Old info:
list_of_DFs and list_of_DFs2 contain dataframes ordered by cities and date: first city's data are on 1st-420th position, from January 1985 to December 2019, second city's on the 421st-840th position etc., so it is quite comfortable to subset required months accordingly to their position in the list.
